How to configure this folder to use ARIMA and SARIMA Notebook

First, you require to install Python 3.6 in your computer

Then you need to create a virtual environment to use Python

A virtual environment is a Python Virtual Installation, in this environment you can install all the libraries required without install directly
in your computer/python local environment

After installing Python 3.6 please, in your terminal run this command:

pip3 install virtualenv


After this, you can create virtual environments

Through your terminal go to Python_DS Folder, then enter this command:

virtualenv -p python3.6 virtual_python


Then you've created a virtual environment called virtual_python


Now you need to activate your virtual environment, now type:

source virtual_python/bin/activate

in your terminal you'll see at the beginnign of your command line the name of your virtual environment (virtual_python)


Now you need to install all the libraries we need to execute the Jupyter Notebook and work with ARIMA and SARIMA, type in your terminal:

pip install -r Requirements.txt

Be sure that you are in the Python_DS folder and Requirements.txt file is there


After this, you're ready to run Jupyter Notebook and work with Data Science in Python, move to ARIMA_SARIMA folder and type

jupyter-notebook


A local server will start and then a web page will be opened, that's all. You are ready to work with Python and Data Science.


ARIMA - Epidemiology.ipynb is the Notebook where ARIMA and SARIMA work are stored
